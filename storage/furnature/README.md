Storage / Furniture

So, unsurprisingly if you've ever met me, my life is a bit of a mess.  Unsurprisingly, if you've ever been to a hackspace, my makerspace is also a bit of a mess.  (Physically, that is.  Emotionally and mentally they are a bit of a mess too, but that's outside the scope of this document.)  

I should probably go on a bit of a rant, or possibly an explanation here, of what I want in furniture, but I should also probably do that up a level, talking about storage in general, and how it needs to be able to evolve over time.  Also, how drawers are good.

Anyway, when I saw Jer's modular cabinet system, I immediately thought how good it seemed, especially for the space.  It is designed primarily as a workshop storage system.  However, I'm pretty shit at actually making stuff, especially a large amount of repeated stuff, with my own two hands and basic tools.  I'm sloppy and easily distracted.  I don't like doing the same thing over and over again.  Excepting, of course, the same dark patterns in my life that drive me to depression and ruin, but that's outside the scope of this document.

Anyway, a furniture-scale wood-cutting CNC would be great.  My ideal goal is to make as close as possible to one-click Ikea furniture: every piece is cut to size, every fastener has a hole waiting for it.  Fortunately, such a thing for DIYers, spaces, and the like exists in the form of a Maslow.  The space's has recently become operational and ready to be inducted on, so hopefully soon?
