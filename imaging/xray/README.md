X-Ray
===

I'd like to have an x-ray, or better, CT scanner for various sorts of shenanigans.

Isn't that dangerous?

Probably.  But that's not a very useful question.  Much better is "in what ways is that dangerous", "what can we do to lower the danger while keeping the utility", "what is the optimal mix of danger and utility".

An x-ray machine, like many sorts of imaging systems, has different parts to it.  X-rays are dangerous to living tissue, so keep the x-rays and the living tissue in different parts!  I'm not particularly interested in imaging living humans.  Like, it'd be cool and all, but there's so many less dangerous and cool things to do that are less likely to give me cancer, and require much smaller chambers.

So, what sort of objects *do* we want to image?  I'd like to be able to put in gadgets of various sorts in order to get an idea of how they are put together and how to best take them apart.  I'd like to be able to put in PCBs in order to, hopefully, get clean images of where the traces go.  It'd be nice to be able to take images of these things from multiple angles in order to combine them later and get a 3d model.  Fortunately, all of these things are amenable, at least somewhat, to holding still.

Let's do some metaphors with normal photography.  You've got a subject you want to take a picture of.  You need some lights.  Without lights, you aren't going to see anything after all.  You light up a room, some of the light reflects off of the subject, great.  You take your camera, press the button, you capture an image.  What determines the brightness of the image?  Well, there's how bright the light in the room was, and how long the exposure time was.  (There's also the ISO/gain, and the properties of your lens, and probably a billion other things if you think about it for too long, but let's try to start with the first two.)

One of the bad things about taking images of living things is that they do not sit still.  That means you need to take pictures of them very quickly or you just get a big blur.  In order to stop them moving you need to make them no longer be living things, and that is something we wish to avoid for this project.  That means you need to use very bright lights.

We aren't taking pictures of living things.  That means we can use dimmer lights for longer, which is nice, because making a dim x-ray source is a lot easier than making a bright one.
