Good feedback is either positive or actionable.  "Good work!" is perfectly acceptable.  "Bad work!" needs further information.  What about it was bad?  What needs more clarification, what do you disagree with?

"That's not the best way to do that" needs you to tell me what way you think it is better, and more importantly why you think it is better.  "That's not how they do it in industry."  Well, OK, that's a bit of data ... but it's fairly likely I already knew that.  How they do it in industry is not necessarily the best way for me to do it.  A lot of things in industry are the way they are because how you efficiently make 10,000 of a part is different than how you make 10 of a part.  A lot of it is because an hour of a professional's time is worth more than an hour of my time.

Some of it is just different because the existing ways of doing it are good enough.  Sometimes I'm doing things in a way I know has been considered and discarded by mainline thought in the field, but I don't understand *why* it has been discarded, and I would like to figure it out.

I'm also generally interested to know in what you'd like me to write about next.  This can be more of an existing topic, or a new topic.  Honestly, it can be anything I've ever mentioned having thoughts on, anything you think I might have thought about, or anything you think, if I were to think on it, my thoughts might be interesting, if only to myself.

I don't promise to actually write about what people request, but I'd like to know anyway.
